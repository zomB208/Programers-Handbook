### Does CSS have a definite format like HTML?
No, not necessarily. For webpages, CSS acts as a side-kick to its HTML counterpart, making elements and attributes more visually appealing for both humans, and digital readers. However, it is important to organize your CSS selectors in a way that you can easily find each. For example, you should keep all of your **element** selectors, **.class** selectors, and **#id** selectors together to keep them organized.

## CSS Selectors

In CSS, there are 5 main types of selectors:
- Simple Selectors
- Combinator Selectors
- Pseudo-class Selectors
- Pseudo-element Selectors
- Attribute Selectors
